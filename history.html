              Drones are unmanned aerial vehicles which are controlled by their
              pilots on the ground through many forms of instruments but mainly
              a remote control. FPV or first person view flying is the ability
              of the pilot to control the aircraft from the aircraft’s
              perspective. The drone has a camera on board along with many
              receivers and transmitters which transmit live image to the pilot.
              With basic parelence out of the way, the history of multi-rotor
              drones begins with the success and popularization of mobile
              smartphones. Accelerometers and gyroscopes, which are responsible
              for keeping images on a smartphone upright, became mass produced
              and affordable for enthusiasts to purchase. In the context of
              drones they are an instrumental component in maintaining a smooth
              flight. These advancements coupled with more accessible 3D
              printing technology has made this a more consumer facing interest
              to have. While the hobby has advanced in the past 5 years at a
              breakneck pace, it's fair to say that it's still very young.

              There are a variety of form factors that drones can take. From
              airplane-like fixed-wing crafts to multi-rotor 5-inch freestyle
              drones like the one on the left of the screen. Drones can be
              designed and optimized for a variety of tasks but in the FPV
              context, it’s either racing or freestyle. ‘Racing’ refers to
              racing drones against one another in a variety of different races.
              On the other hand, ‘freestyle’ refers to expressing oneself
              through flying the drone. Some examples to both, are linked below:
