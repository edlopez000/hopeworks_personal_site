            <h2>Reddit</h2>
            <p>
              While Reddit as a platform is not without its faults, it is home
              to the most openly available enthusiast communities and among them
              is a collection of FPV related subreddits. Anyone new to the hobby
              or merely interested can peruse the subreddits below and see how
              much the community seeks to help one another. As previously
              mentioned, the hobby is still in its wild-west phase where nothing
              is standardized and the learning curve is a bit steep. So any
              beginner will have to pick up skills that they previously might
              not have possessed like for example: soldering. The community is
              there to help in case you face some issue with some hyper-specific
              issue.

              In many instances, the communities linked above can serve as the
              best resource in most cases. But in other situations, Joshua
              Bardwell is most hobbyists' next stop for anything FPV drone
              related. Bardwell runs a shopping list that helps beginners know
              what the best equipment in categories ranging from goggles to
              battery chargers. He also runs a youtube channel with hundreds of
              videos detailing the most basic to the most complex topics and
              concepts in FPV.
