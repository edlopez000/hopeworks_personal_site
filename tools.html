              Without this tool, it wouldn’t be possible to fly the craft
              through first person view. Goggles come in a variety of shapes and
              sizes with each one facilitating different fidelity and video
              quality. Goggles come into two distinct camps when it comes to
              image quality: analog or digital. These two camps refer to the
              method that the video signal is transferred by. As in almost all
              instances, the digital signal is significantly greater. In the
              flying page, you will see an example of how it looks to fly
              through an analog and digital pair of goggles.

              While at first glance, the remote might look like a daunting
              instrument with an almost comical amount of switches and gimbals
              but it isn't. It is your primary interface for controlling the
              drone in the takeoff, flying, and landing stages. The picture
              above is of the traditional RC transmitters which are fully
              featured and ready for other remote control aircrafts.
              Manufacturers have also started selling a different form factor of
              transmitters. This form factor resembles the prototypical video
              game controller, for example the PS5 controller. [include hover

              Drones are made up of many different components, among them: a
              flight controller, electronic speed controller, motors, camera,
              and video transmitter. The flight controller is the central
              processing unit for the drone and is responsible for understanding
              the drone’s position in 3D space and also for distributing the
              signals received from the transmitter to the electronic speed
              controllers. The ESCs are electronic components that regulate the
              electricity delivered to the motors. There are typically four
              motors that spin and propel the drone in any direction. Lastly the
              camera and video transmitter are responsible for capturing and
              distributing imagery.
