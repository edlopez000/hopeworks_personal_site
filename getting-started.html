            <h2>Practice</h2>
            <p>
              Unless the pilot has previous experience, it can be difficult to
              have a successful first flight that doesn’t begin and end with a
              wild drone flying around threatening everyone's safety. For this
              particular reason, it is recommended that you practice in a
              simulator beforehand. No simulator achieves a perfect simulacrum
              of real-world flight but they do help in teaching the mechanics of
              flying with gimbals (also called sticks). The one that is most
              recommended is Velocidrone. While the simulator can be played
              using many instruments, it is best to practice with a RC
              transmitter. But if you want to get experience right now, you can
              try out Droning About's proprietary simulator software by clicking
              the link below.

            <h2>Flying</h2>
            <p>
              Flying is all about putting together all the things you learned in
              your simulator practice hours. You should understand the
              transmitter well enough to be able to identify how the two sticks
              control the throttle, yaw, roll, and pitch. In the first couple
              flying sessions, practicing landing and taking off is key. Losing
              a drone in your first flight is never fun and neither is having to
              look for it in a large field. Aside from the mechanics of flying,
              picking locations that are safe for everyone is also important.
              Drones can go pretty fast and their propellers spin even faster.
              It’s important to select locations that are relatively isolated.
